### Technical Assets

#### Content update
The update loop uses ```window.requestAnimationFrame()``` to update the game when not paused.

The ```update``` function is used to move the characters using ```element.moveChar``` and check interaction using ```checkCollision()```. Each element behave differently upon collision.


#### Element creation
The ```generateEnemy```, ```generateBullet```, ```generateUpgrade```, ```generateCat``` functions are used to create elements using the ```Character``` class.

The ```Character``` class is used to create all game elements on the gameBoard.
```
class Character {
  constructor(
    type, //player, enemy, bullet, pet
    id, //element identifier
    sizeX, //element size
    sizeY,
    spdX, //movement speed
    spdY,
    hp, /character health
    x, //location on gameBoard
    y,
    atkSpd, //attack speed
    bulletOwner, //who shot the bullet
    aniFrame, //animation counter
    aimAngle //bullet direction
  )

  addChar()
  //adds the character element to the gameBoard

  removeChar()
  //removes the character element from the gameBoard

  moveChar()
  //moves and animates the character

  shoot()
  //Generates a bullet at the character's position
  //Ghoots it to the aimAngle.
  //All characters can shoot. Even pets and bullets.
```



##### Levels

3 Levels with varying enemy spawn rates base on a timer. Past a certain point, enemies stop spawning and once all enemies are dead, the game is won.
